Before running the executable, make sure that the "resources" directory and its contents, and the files "shader.fs" and "shader.vs" are in the same directory as the executable "Assignment0.exe".

Then run "Assignment1.exe"

When using the program, use the GUI to move the camera, change render settings, and change light color and settings.

To load a new model, imput the name of a object file in the "resources/objects" directory ("cube.obj", "cyborg.obj", "rock.obj", or "two_cubes.obj") and press the "reload model" button.
